                <h1> About me </h1>
                <p> 
My name is Sebastian Hubenschmid. I'm a 23 years old computer scientist from a small village in southern Germany, and I currently live near Canterbury, UK.
                </p>



                <h1> About my work </h1>
                <p> 
I'm a Junior Software Developer at ionCube Software LLP, and I'm close to finishing my BA in Computer Science at the University of Konstanz. I specialised in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and I love implementing complex, maintainable and extendable applications that perform well. 
                </p>


                <h1> About this site </h1>
                <p> 
This website serves as a central place for information about me, such as links to my social media profiles or public information about projects I participated in. The links provided in the sidebar do not represent all my presences on the internet, but these are the ones that I keep up-to-date.

<p>
<em> I normally do not work on anything web-related (such as websites, mobile / javascript apps), as I have no experience as web-designer nor web-developer. This website is the only exclusion. </em>
